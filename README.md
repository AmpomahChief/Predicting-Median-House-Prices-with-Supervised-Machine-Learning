# Predicting median housing prices using the CRISP-DM. 
This project was about using the KNIME Analytics Platform to train and build a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California using the California census data from 1990. This project required using the CRISP-DM framework, which involves the following steps.

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling 
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

This project made use of various supervised machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. These algorithms were tested until the best one with the least errors was selected.
